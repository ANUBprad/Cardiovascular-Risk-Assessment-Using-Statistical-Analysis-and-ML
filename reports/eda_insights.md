# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Insights

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of structured clinical and lifestyle data collected from over 4,000 individuals, with the target variable representing the presence or absence of 10-year cardiovascular disease risk.

## Key Observations

### Age
- Individuals diagnosed with cardiovascular disease tend to be significantly older.
- Median age is notably higher in the diseased group, indicating age as a primary risk factor.

### Cholesterol
- Total cholesterol levels show higher variability among diseased patients.
- Elevated cholesterol contributes to increased cardiovascular risk, especially when combined with age.

### Blood Pressure
- Systolic blood pressure demonstrates a strong positive correlation with disease occurrence.
- Hypertension-related features are consistently higher in the affected population.

### Heart Rate
- Lower heart rate values are observed among high-risk individuals, suggesting compromised cardiovascular fitness.

### Smoking and Lifestyle Factors
- Smoking status and smoking intensity are positively associated with disease prevalence.
- Lifestyle indicators play a meaningful role alongside clinical variables.

## Correlation Analysis
- Strong correlations were observed between cardiovascular disease and:
  - Age
  - Systolic blood pressure
  - Diabetes
  - Smoking indicators
- These relationships informed subsequent feature engineering and model selection.

## Summary
EDA revealed clear demographic, clinical, and lifestyle patterns associated with cardiovascular disease risk, validating the suitability of the dataset for statistical analysis and predictive modeling.
